# OBFShellcode
Just a little dev time exploring other avenues to hide shellcode, I personally tried this with actual payloads and it did not do the job, for some odd reason calc popped though. Just something to upload considering the majority of my real work is private.
I found the following repo and wanted to implement it, encrypt and decrypt in memory at runtime is just much smoother was just just curious though. This brings alot of junk with it but I tailored a little bit inside and got majority of inspiration from the following repo: https://github.com/ORCx41/HellShell
